# Cur
Cur is a free, modern cursor pack, which could let you focus without transparency effect. We added glow for the user's attraction.
# Why did we remove the transparency effect?
Because if we do that, your cursor will be hard to set up. So that is why you don't need to set the transparency effect!
# At first...
We maded our concept first and we finally created our cursor pack. Take a look at our cursor pack and video.
